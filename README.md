# About

Hey, a Android noob here. I wanted to have my `Lock.ogg` and `Unlock.ogg` sound on my Android 14 Fairphone 5 device replaced, rooted my phone and experienced that it is not possible so simply replace any file in `/system`.

Luckily I found out that with [Magisk](https://github.com/topjohnwu/Magisk) (which I also used for rooting my phone) you can have so called _modules_, which e.g. replace files in `/system`. Also I found out that it's quite easy for it to work, if you only want to replace such simple files like OGG files.

# Install

1. Download the ZIP from [releases](https://github.com/Tagirijus/tagi_replace_ui_sounds/releases) to your phone.
2. Go to the _Magsik_ tab for modules and choose _Install from storage_.
3. Choose the ZIP you downloaded.
4. Reboot.

# Disclaimer

Since I am a total noob when it comes to such Magisk modules and since it's technically about changing files in `/system` I am not liable for any damage you do to your system with this module. It works on my Fairphone 5, as far as I tested it.
